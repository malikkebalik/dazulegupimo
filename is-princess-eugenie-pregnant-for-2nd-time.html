The Brooksbank family, including Andrew and Fergie, as well as the<a href=# rel=noopener> Queen</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Prince Philip</a>, “are overjoyed by the news,” according to the Palace.</p><p>Another cute snapshot of the soon-to-be parents was posted to Instagram by Eugenie and it showed the couple cuddling a pair of fluffy baby bear slippers.</p><p>And Fergie tweeted about being a grandma, too: “What wonderful news that Eugenie and Jack are having their first child. I’m really happy for them and I can’t wait to become a grandmother. The Yorks are expecting a bundle of joy, and they can’t wait to meet their new little member.”</p><p>Next month will mark the couple’s second wedding anniversary. They had a beautiful ceremony in October 2018 at Windsor Castle. Princess Beatrice, Eugenie’s older sister, married Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi in a secret ceremony in July, making this a momentous year for the royal family.</p><p>The pair had intended to get married in May, but the spread of the coronavirus caused them to postpone the ceremony. The Queen, Prince Philip and other members of the <a href=# rel=noopener>royal family</a> attended the service. below you will read details about is Princess Eugenie Pregnant for 2nd Time or not?</p><h2>Is Princess Eugenie Pregnant?</h2><p>Beatrice and Eugenie the daughters of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, are very close and likely enjoy spending time with their children, August and Sienna, together. Here are<a href=# rel=noopener> Prince Louis</a>, Mia Tindall and the rest of the royal kids acting like rascals for the cameras.</p><p>Beatrice and her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi welcomed their daughter Sienna in September 2021; <strong>Eugenie and her husband Jack Brooksbank welcomed their son August,</strong> now 21 months, in February 2021. Their daughter is currently 14 months old. Due to their shared experience as only children, <strong>Beatrice and Eugenie are prime candidates for having more than one child.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Princess-Eugenie-son.jpg><p>August and Sienna are less than two years apart in age, and they are both rapidly nearing the age of two, so <a href=# rel=noopener>HELLO!</a> We wouldn’t be shocked if the royal family announced a pregnancy, and it would be especially sweet if both sisters and brothers were expecting at the same time.</p><p>“August Brooksbank, Eugenie’s firstborn, was born in February 2021, while the family was confined and unable to visit. No guests were permitted at hospitals after births, and many expectant mothers faced limitations at their antenatal sessions due to the pandemic.”</p><p>“In an interview with The Telegraph in 2008, Eugenie described her family as “The Tripod,” consisting of herself, Sarah, Duchess of York, and sister Beatrice. They are the most wonderful people I have ever met.</p><p>Given their strong sibling ties, I have no doubt that August and Sienna will be encouraged by Eugenie and Beatrice to do the same with their own siblings.</p><p>It would be wonderful for Beatrice and Eugenie to be expecting twins at the same time, so they could support each other when they become second-time mothers and share advice on how to manage two young children.</p><p>If Beatrice and her sister are both pregnant at the same time, they’ll both get to enjoy the same degree of freedom as Beatrice did while carrying their daughter. Beatrice and Edoardo have opted to keep their daughter Sienna out of the spotlight, therefore we have yet to see a photo of her.</p><p>The young royal was spotted at the late Queen’s Platinum Jubilee celebrations, and Eugenie has posted several cute photos of August on her Instagram page. The crowds cheered as August, dressed in the cutest Union Flag jumper, waved to them during the <a href=# rel=noopener>Jubilee Pageant</a>.</p><p><strong>In October, Eugenie shared a photo of herself walking with her mom, Sarah, while carrying her infant son, August, in a sling.</strong> It reads as she penned it: “There’s still half an hour left in 2022, so better late than never, right? Wishing you a wonderful year, dear momsy!”</p><p>Sarah has already mentioned her regal grandchildren, about whom she is extremely proud. She mentioned to Metro that she reads her kids’ bedtime stories. “August is such a cute little guy; right now we’re playing with trucks, but if he ever decides he’d rather play with Barbies, that’s totally cool with me.”</p><p>Then she elaborated: “It’s hilarious because, at seven and a half months old, I can tell that August likes me when he smiles at me. It’s not an act; fortunately, he finds me hilarious in my natural state.”</p><p><strong>Final Lines</strong></p><p>What do you think is Princess Eugenie Pregnant? How many kids does she have?
