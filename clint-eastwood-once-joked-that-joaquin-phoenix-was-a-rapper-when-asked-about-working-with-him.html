But Eastwood took the time to address the speculation, and why it was wrong.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-clint-eastwood-responded-to-working-with-joaquin-phoenix>How Clint Eastwood responded to working with Joaquin Phoenix</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Clint-Eastwood-Joaquin-Phoenix.jpg><p id=par-2_49>Eastwood and DiCaprio teamed up to tell the story of J. Edgar Hoover in the titular feature J. Edgar. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a>, DiCaprio shared that he jumped at the opportunity to do the film. Partially because it presented some <a href=#>unique challenges for his career</a>.</p><p id=par-3_39>“When I can’t immediately define the character, and there’s an element of mystery to it and still a lot to be explored, that’s when I say yes,” DiCaprio said. “I like those kinds of complicated characters. I just do.”</p><p id=par-4_16>Likewise, Eastwood was impressed by DiCaprio’s willingness to play more unconventional roles given the star’s status.</p><p id=par-5_39>“Leonardo <a href=#>could make a lot of money</a> making mechanical genre pictures, but he wants to be challenged,” Eastwood added. “And it’s much more of a challenge to play someone who doesn’t have the slightest thing in common with you.”</p><p id=par-6_31>There were also rumors that Phoenix was going to co-star in the film as DiCaprio’s lover. But Eastwood was quick to shoot down the reports, and referenced Phoenix’s fictional side career.</p><p id=par-7_17>“No. I don’t know where that came from,” Eastwood once told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reuters</a>. “Didn’t he become a rapper?”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-joaquin-phoenix-thought-playing-a-rapper-would-backfire-on-him>Joaquin Phoenix thought playing a rapper would backfire on him</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_66>It was soon revealed that Phoenix’s rap career was all a part of the Casey Affleck mockumentary I’m Still Here. The movie required Phoenix <a href=#>to stay in character</a> as much as possible, misleading real-life fans into thinking the actor was having a breakdown. In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Roger Ebert</a>, Affleck explained why it was so important to keep their true intentions hidden from the general public.</p><p id=par-9_50>“The reason it was MADE without comment and with Joaquin in character when in public was because the media plays a role in the film and the media would not have played their role as well as they did had it been acknowledged that Joaquin was only performing,” Affleck said.</p><p id=par-10_13>Phoenix, however, worried that his antics might have dramatic consequences for his career.</p><p id=par-11_53>“The only thing that bothered me was that it might be difficult for me to work again as I wasn’t retiring and I wanted to continue to make films. So the only thing that gave me pause was the fact it might <a href=#>really affect my career</a>,” Phoenix said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Shortlist</a>.</p><p id=par-12_21>Fortunately, it seemed that Phoenix had nothing to worry about, and his career continued to thrive even after I’m Still Here.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-joaquin-phoenix-received-help-from-diddy-to-pass-as-a-rapper-for-i-m-still-here>Joaquin Phoenix received help from Diddy to pass as a rapper for ‘I’m Still Here’</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-13_51>Not very many celebrities were in on Phoenix’s and Affleck’s farce. Diddy was one of the few aware of the secret, and convincingly played along to add authenticity to Affleck’s vision. To further his rap career, Phoenix pretended to follow the <a href=#>hip hop mogul</a>‘s guidance ,which was all an elaborate ruse.</p><p id=par-14_89>“So we went to his house and it was just like, ‘Will you do this?’ and he said, ‘Yeah, I’ve got to go to this party, then I’ll go and meet you and we’ll do a scene in the hotel,’” Phoenix told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Interview</a> about his exchange with Diddy. “So I said, ‘Look, can we also just get you when you’re leaving right now? We’re just going to pretend that we’re pulling up to your house and that you’re leaving and that I missed the appointment, I missed the meeting.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSwrbXNrWSemaOpxLC7w2ahqKOVmXqru8CqrKKmXaW1sLHNoq9mqpGlvaa%2BjJqqpJ2UYsSwvsqipaBmmKm6rXs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fclint-eastwood-once-joked-that-joaquin-phoenix-was-a-rapper-when-asked-about-working-with-him.html&text=Clint%20Eastwood%20Once%20Joked%20That%20Joaquin%20Phoenix%20Was%20a%20Rapper%20When%20Asked%20About%20Working%20With%20Him&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fclint-eastwood-once-joked-that-joaquin-phoenix-was-a-rapper-when-asked-about-working-with-him.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fclint-eastwood-once-joked-that-joaquin-phoenix-was-a-rapper-when-asked-about-working-with-him.html&title=Clint%20Eastwood%20Once%20Joked%20That%20Joaquin%20Phoenix%20Was%20a%20Rapper%20When%20Asked%20About%20Working%20With%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fclint-eastwood-once-joked-that-joaquin-phoenix-was-a-rapper-when-asked-about-working-with-him.html&title=Clint%20Eastwood%20Once%20Joked%20That%20Joaquin%20Phoenix%20Was%20a%20Rapper%20When%20Asked%20About%20Working%20With%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fclint-eastwood-once-joked-that-joaquin-phoenix-was-a-rapper-when-asked-about-working-with-him.html&title=Clint%20Eastwood%20Once%20Joked%20That%20Joaquin%20Phoenix%20Was%20a%20Rapper%20When%20Asked%20About%20Working%20With%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fclint-eastwood-once-joked-that-joaquin-phoenix-was-a-rapper-when-asked-about-working-with-him.html&description=Clint%20Eastwood%20Once%20Joked%20That%20Joaquin%20Phoenix%20Was%20a%20Rapper%20When%20Asked%20About%20Working%20With%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ct-tamburello-and-diem-brown-s-complete-relationship-timeline.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="CT Tamburello and Diem Brown's Complete Relationship Timeline">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./a-special-delivery-for-rosemary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="A Special Delivery for Rosemary">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
