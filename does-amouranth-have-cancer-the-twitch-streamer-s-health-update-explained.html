Due to “extreme medical developments,” she announced she was pulling out of her boxing match at La Velada Del Año 3.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>In addition to streaming on Twitch, posting ASMR videos to YouTube, and uploading adult content to OnlyFans, Amouranth was to make her boxing debut against Spanish streamer Maite Carrillo, aka Mayichi, on July 1. However, all that has been put on pause due to her diagnosis of late-stage ovarian failure.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-amouranth-s-late-stage-ovarian-failure-and-what-it-means-for-her-health data-injectable=false>Amouranth’s late-stage ovarian failure and what it means for her health</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Beyond that, my body has been in perimenopause/menopause for some time.

According to her, she was experiencing “perimenopause/menopause for some time,” a process by which a woman’s ovaries gradually stop working. Typically, this occurs in a person’s 40s or 50s, but Amouranth is 29 years old.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I will be undergoing daily injections for 7-14 days during which I will (potentially) suffer from headaches, nausea and aches, which would be no big deal, and was also warned against “high impact physical activities”.

Because strenuous physical activity such as boxing can result in her ovaries “torsioning/twisting,” she decided to back out of her fight.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I had hoped to just box through the symptoms, as I could handle a little nausea or some headaches, but my medical team strenuously vetoed that decision due to the “potential for extreme injury or death” related to a heightened chance of my ovaries torsioning/twisting while</p>— Amouranth (@Amouranth) <a href=#>June 26, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=296 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>Although these symptoms are relatively mild to Amouranth, her doctor warned her that the “torsioning/twisting” of her ovaries during strenuous activities could result in “extreme injury or death.” As such, she has decided to put her health first and her boxing ambitions second.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>get the opportunity to get in the ring next year if everything goes well.</p>— Amouranth (@Amouranth) <a href=#>June 26, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=623 data-current-count=923 data-injectable=true>There are two types of ovarian failure, which also go by the name ovarian insufficiency. The first, or primary, can be caused by either the removal of the ovaries from surgery, cancer treatments, or genetic conditions. The second can be the result of certain medications, possible eating disorders, or too much exercise; in this case, the ovaries are ordinary but aren’t receiving the proper hormonal signals from the brain. “This is usually caused by diseases of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus,” according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">National Cancer Institute</a>. Amouranth did not elaborate on the potential origin of her diagnosis.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>Late-stage ovarian failure means Amouranth is potentially experiencing notable menopause symptoms, including irregular periods, mood changes, chills, hot flashes, sleep problems, night sweats, and more, according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mayo Clinic</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Does late-stage ovarian failure mean Amouranth has cancer?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/amouranth-1.jpg><p data-characters=371 data-current-count=371 data-injectable=false>Late-stage ovarian failure sounds scary (and it can be), but it does not immediately mean a person has cancer. The reason people think of cancer when they hear late-stage ovarian failure is because cancer treatments can sometimes cause such failures. Nevertheless, Amouranth’s diagnosis, like any woman’s experience with menopause, does not mean she has cancer.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=640 data-injectable=true>Of course, it’s never good to assume the status of a person’s health without their consent, so until Amouranth chooses to elaborate further, it’s best to take her word at face value, which is that she is experiencing late-stage ovarian failure, and that’s it.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=506 data-current-count=506 data-injectable=false>Treatment for this typically focuses on estrogen therapy in the form of injections, which it sounds like Amouranth will be undergoing. That said, the Twitch streamer did not share much more beyond the fact that she will be undergoing treatment, that it will persist for around two weeks, and that she will step out of the spotlight for a bit as a result, which is understandable. Should she choose to keep the rest of her medical journey private, that’s entirely up to her, and we wish her all the best.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxsLHSZpimp6Wnrq%2FAx2afmq6VYrCiusKeqWasmJp6tcPIrZqhZaOpv6atzJ6prGWYmq6twMdmrKmckamybrHXqaOaoZ6asXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdoes-amouranth-have-cancer-the-twitch-streamer-s-health-update-explained.html&text=Does%20Amouranth%20have%20cancer%3f%20The%20Twitch%20streamers%20health%20update%2c%20explained&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdoes-amouranth-have-cancer-the-twitch-streamer-s-health-update-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-amouranth-have-cancer-the-twitch-streamer-s-health-update-explained.html&title=Does%20Amouranth%20have%20cancer%3f%20The%20Twitch%20streamers%20health%20update%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdoes-amouranth-have-cancer-the-twitch-streamer-s-health-update-explained.html&title=Does%20Amouranth%20have%20cancer%3f%20The%20Twitch%20streamers%20health%20update%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdoes-amouranth-have-cancer-the-twitch-streamer-s-health-update-explained.html&title=Does%20Amouranth%20have%20cancer%3f%20The%20Twitch%20streamers%20health%20update%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdoes-amouranth-have-cancer-the-twitch-streamer-s-health-update-explained.html&description=Does%20Amouranth%20have%20cancer%3f%20The%20Twitch%20streamers%20health%20update%2c%20explained" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jill-dillard-reveals-why-jim-bob-and-michelle-duggar-were-fine-with-jinger-vuolo-wearing-pants.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jill Dillard Reveals Why Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar Were Fine With Jinger Vuolo Wearing Pants">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dixie-d-amelio-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dixie DAmelio Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
