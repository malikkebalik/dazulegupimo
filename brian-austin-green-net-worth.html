Brian is the son of George Green, a country musician. After attending high school in North Hollywood, Brian Green studied at the Hamilton High School Academy of Music.

He spent three years on the show until 1989, and during this period he also found time to appear on shows like Good Morning, Miss Bliss.</p><p>In 1990, Green's breakthrough came with a leading role in Beverly Hills 90210. Cast as David Silver, Brian Austin Green was elevated to widespread fame. This newfound exposure also helped him win guest roles on shows like Growing Pains, Melrose Place, Saved by the Bell, Biker Mice from Mars, Sabrina, the Teenage Witch, and many others during the 90s.</p><p>After Beverly Hills 90210 wrapped in 2000, Brian Austin Green won a minor role in Ressurection Blvd. He then met his future wife Megan Fox on the set of Hope & Faith. Further guest-starring roles came with shows like Freddie, The Twilight Zone, Las Vegas, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, and <a href=# title="George Lopez Net Worth">George Lopez</a>.</p><p>Brian Austin Green then experienced something of a resurgence after joining the cast of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

In 1999, he started dating <a href=# title="Vanessa Marcil Net Worth">Vanessa Marcil</a>, another Beverly Hills 90210 cast member. They later had a son and became engaged, but ended their relationship in 2003.</p><p>In 2004, Green started dating actress Megan Fox. Although they became engaged in 2006, they called it off in 2009. Just one year later, they reaffirmed their plans to marry and were wed in Hawaii soon afterward. However, they divorced in 2015. In 2016, the couple proved that their relationship still had tons of twists and turns left, and they got back together. In 2020, they announced their separation once again. Over the course of their relationship, they have had three children together.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2009, Fox and Green bought a home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles for $2.95 million. They sold this house in 2014 for $3.75 million. As part of their decoupling process in 2016, Brian and Megan began selling some of their real estate assets. They sold one Los Angeles home for $2.6 million and another for $1.299 million.</p><p>Later in 2016 when they had reconciled, Megan and Brian spent $3.3 million on a new 2-acre property in Malibu. The seller was <a href=# title="Brad Pitt Net Worth">Brad Pitt</a>'s manager Cynthia Pett-Dante (wife of comedic actor <a href=# title="Peter Dante Net Worth">Peter Dante</a>). In 2018, Megan sued Cynthia for $5 million, alleging the seller failed to disclose a serious mold problem in the house.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZK%2BztcCnZJqto6m2r3nGq5yepl2jsrV51qipraBf</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbrian-austin-green-net-worth.html&text=Brian%20Austin%20Green%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbrian-austin-green-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbrian-austin-green-net-worth.html&title=Brian%20Austin%20Green%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbrian-austin-green-net-worth.html&title=Brian%20Austin%20Green%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbrian-austin-green-net-worth.html&title=Brian%20Austin%20Green%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbrian-austin-green-net-worth.html&description=Brian%20Austin%20Green%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./keanu-reeves-seen-out-on-a-double-date-with-what-not-to-wear-star.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Keanu Reeves seen out on a double date with What Not To Wear star">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./althea-heart-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Althea Heart Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
