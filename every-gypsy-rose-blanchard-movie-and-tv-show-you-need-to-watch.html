The mother-daughter duo seemed like the ultimate example of “triumph over tragedy” with Dee Dee playing the role of doting mother to Gypsy during her lifelong battle with cancer and other health issues. There was only one catch — Gypsy was never sick.</p><p data-characters=479 data-current-count=479 data-injectable=true>When Dee Dee Blanchard was found murdered in July 2015, it was ultimately revealed that not only was Gypsy a perpetrator but she was also a victim, of her mother’s Munchausen Syndrome By Proxy. In this bizarre true crime story, where fact turned out to be stranger than fiction, it’s no wonder so many TV shows and documentaries are dedicated to unraveling it.
