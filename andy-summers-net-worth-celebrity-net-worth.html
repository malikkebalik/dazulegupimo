Andy later recorded a tribute album entitled "Green Chimneys: The Music of Thelonious Monk" (1999). By the age of 16, Summers had started playing in local clubs, and a few years later, Andy and his friend Zoot Money moved to London and formed the rhythm and blues group Zoot Money's Big Roll Band, which later became an acid rock group known as Dantalian's Chariot.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>After Dantalian's Chariot disbanded in 1968, Summers toured the U.S. with the rock band Soft Machine for three months.
