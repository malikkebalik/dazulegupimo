In case you’ve been living under a rock for the past 20-plus years, <a href=#>The Sopranos</a> was a wildly popular mob show that aired from 1999 to 2007. It wasn’t just the same old show about the Mafia, though; it was thrilling and groundbreaking in that it was brutally graphic and raw, but it was also oddly relatable.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘The Sopranos’: More than a mob show</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/sopranos-gandolfini-by-pool.jpg><p id=par-2_33>The Sopranos followed Tony Soprano, played by the late James Gandolfini, as he headed up two families in New Jersey: his nuclear family comprised of his wife and two children, and the Mafia.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_41>Somehow, The Sopranos balanced its dark and incredibly real-seeming violence with typical suburban America experiences and even some lighthearted humor. Above all else, its characters were relatable and felt authentic (perhaps because several of the actors had <a href=#>real-life Mob ties</a>).</p><p id=par-4_55>Yes, Tony Soprano was a fearsome Mob boss, but he was also a doting family man who went to therapy to cope with panic attacks — a problem many of us can relate to. Those therapy sessions were central to The Sopranos‘ plot and <a href=#>according to Dr. Philip Ringstrom, Ph.D., Psy.D.</a>, they were “refreshingly credible.”</p><p id=par-5_44>Tony Soprano’s therapy helped him with more than just managing his panic attacks. The show, unsurprisingly, frequently featured deaths and one early death was actually a member of the Soprano family. What was more than a little surprising, though, was how producers handled it.&nbsp;</p><h2>Losing Livia</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-6_27>A frequent topic during Tony’s therapy sessions was his mother, Livia. The widowed Mrs. Soprano was manipulative, ornery, and downright unkind, even on her best days.</p><p id=par-7_56>You could say that she and Tony had an interesting relationship, and it took an even more interesting turn when Livia put a hit out on him after he put her in a nursing home. It’s no wonder that <a href=#>RollingStone named Livia Soprano No. 3</a> on its list of “40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time.”</p><p id=par-8_39>Sadly, the actress who played Livia, Nancy Marchand, died shortly after Season 2 of The Sopranos&nbsp;finished production. <a href=#>According to Playbill</a>, Marchand died on June 18, 2001, the day before her 72nd birthday, after battling lung cancer for several years.</p><p id=par-9_63>In the Season 2 finale, Tony visited Livia, despite the fact that he had all but disowned her. Ultimately, Tony demanded that his mother leave the country and he provided her with stolen first-class airline tickets. Livia heeded Tony’s advice and attempted to use the tickets, but was detained by security at the Newark Airport. Shortly afterward, Tony is arrested by the FBI.</p><p id=par-10_39><a href=#>According to The Sopranos wiki on Fandom</a>, show producers planned to have Livia testify against Tony in court about the stolen tickets in Season 3. However, Marchand died before Season 3 filming began, so that storyline couldn’t be used.&nbsp;</p><h2>They did…what?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-11_76>Producers obviously had to acknowledge Marchand’s death, but the way they went about it left many — if not most — fans scratching their heads. <a href=#>As ScreenRant explained</a>: “It would have made sense to establish that Livia had passed away in her sleep, during the gap between Season 2 and 3. Instead, they CGI’d her head onto the body of another actress, for an unusual scene where she reacts to Tony’s statements in a nonsensical way.”</p><p id=par-12_60>For anyone unfamiliar with the term, CGI stands for computer-generated imagery, and it’s a <a href=#>common but polarizing special effect</a> used primarily in action movies. In the case of Livia Soprano, producers brought her back for just a few brief scenes in the Season 3 premiere by superimposing her head onto another actor’s body and using audio from previously-filmed outtakes.</p><p id=par-13_26>Later in the episode, it is revealed that Livia died in her sleep, which, according to ScreenRant, “is what they should have said to begin with.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMrKapqpGjvLR5wqucnqiZocZuwdKem2abl556tbuMn6ClpV2btq%2Bty2aqnJ2emnq4tdOhZJpllJqupXnCmqqtZZ2auqOx0WefraWcZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-sopranos-creepily-used-cgi-to-film-final-scene-with-a-dead-cast-member.html&text=%27The%20Sopranos%27%20Creepily%20Used%20CGI%20to%20Film%20Final%20Scene%20With%20a%20Dead%20Cast%20Member&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-sopranos-creepily-used-cgi-to-film-final-scene-with-a-dead-cast-member.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-sopranos-creepily-used-cgi-to-film-final-scene-with-a-dead-cast-member.html&title=%27The%20Sopranos%27%20Creepily%20Used%20CGI%20to%20Film%20Final%20Scene%20With%20a%20Dead%20Cast%20Member" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-sopranos-creepily-used-cgi-to-film-final-scene-with-a-dead-cast-member.html&title=%27The%20Sopranos%27%20Creepily%20Used%20CGI%20to%20Film%20Final%20Scene%20With%20a%20Dead%20Cast%20Member" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-sopranos-creepily-used-cgi-to-film-final-scene-with-a-dead-cast-member.html&title=%27The%20Sopranos%27%20Creepily%20Used%20CGI%20to%20Film%20Final%20Scene%20With%20a%20Dead%20Cast%20Member" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-sopranos-creepily-used-cgi-to-film-final-scene-with-a-dead-cast-member.html&description=%27The%20Sopranos%27%20Creepily%20Used%20CGI%20to%20Film%20Final%20Scene%20With%20a%20Dead%20Cast%20Member" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./grady-demond-wilson-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Grady Demond Wilson Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./barefoot-contessa-has-a-few-secret-hacks-for-the-best-comfort-food.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Barefoot Contessa' Has a Few Secret Hacks for the Best Comfort Food">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
