Spencer and Trina talked about how much they wanted this before Trina started to undo the buttons on his shirt.</p><p>However, Spencer shut Trina down since he wanted their first time together to be perfect – not in an empty gallery or on a night when she was in so much pain.</p><p>Trina giggled and joked that she wasn’t so sure she liked Spencer when he was being noble.</p><p>Spencer decided to take Trina home, but she didn’t want to go back to her dorm room or the Metro Court.</p><p>Once Spencer got an idea of somewhere that would be safe, he led Trina out the door.</p><p>At The Savoy, Marshall Ashford (Robert Gossett) found Curtis Ashford (Donnell Turner) drinking alone and demanded to know what happened.</p><p>Curtis offered updates on Portia Robinson’s (Brook Kerr) lie and the possibility that Trina might be his daughter.</p><p>After Curtis mentioned that Stella Henry (Vernee Watson) found out and Jordan Ashford (Tanisha Harper) knew too, he suggested the people most affected by the lie were the last to know.</p><p>Curtis didn’t understand how Portia could keep a secret this huge for so long, but Marshall talked about putting his own secret in a box for 40 years.</p><p>That made Marshall more understanding of Portia’s situation, but Curtis felt that some things were unforgivable.</p><p>Even so, Marshall reminded Curtis that he’d forgiven his father and helped Marshall rediscover a family that he thought he’d lost forever.</p><p>Portia was Curtis’ wife in the eyes of God and the state of New York – plus, Curtis might have a daughter.</p><p>With all that in mind, Marshall urged Curtis not to shut himself off from the woman he loved because she was human.</p><p>After Marshall said he’d always be there to support him, Curtis cried and hugged his father.</p><p>On the pier, Alexis Davis (Nancy Lee Grahn) told Kevin Collins (Jon Lindstrom) and Laura Collins (Genie Francis) that Heather Webber (Alley Mills) was “The Hook.”</p><p>Alexis had figured it out through the letter and a very specific keystroke on an old typewriter at D’Archam Asylum.</p><p>Kevin realized this was a family affair and that Heather was likely Esme Prince’s (Avery Pohl) “avenging angel” mother.</p><p>At Wyndemere, Ava Jerome (Maura West) asked Heather how a man locked up in prison destroyed her life, but Heather thought it was obvious that Ryan Chamberlain (Jon Lindstrom) had help.</p><p>Austin Gatlin Holt (Roger Howarth) regained consciousness nearby, but Ava got Heather’s attention back on whatever she was trying to say.</p><p>Heather ultimately said it wasn’t her story to tell, but she assured Ava that she could end this and handed her the gun.</p><p>Felicia Scorpio (Kristina Wagner) urged Ava to shoot Heather, who said that wouldn’t solve Ava’s problem.</p><p>If Ava shot Ryan, on the other hand, that’d be a different story.</p><p>Felicia wanted Ava to forget about all this and get out of there so they could call 911 for Austin.</p><p>Instead, armed Ava decided Heather was right and took off to finish what Ryan started.</p><p>Soon after, Jordan and Mac Scorpio arrived with backup. A detective arrested Heather – and the bloody hook was bagged for evidence.</p><p>There were concerns about Austin as Mac called for paramedics, but Heather admitted there was no venom this time.</p><p>That meant Austin’s injuries weren’t life-threatening.</p><p>Mac reeled over Felicia’s news that Ava was armed when she took off after Ryan.</p><p>When questions emerged about what Ryan wanted with Esme, Heather told Jordan and Mac that he was her daddy.</p><p>Mac convinced Felicia to go with Austin and the paramedics to the mainland, especially since Austin confessed to wanting some company.</p><p>In the woods, Ryan insisted they needed to get Esme back inside the warm house since the baby was coming, but she was reluctant to go with him.</p><p>After Ryan said Esme used to worship him, he talked about his plans with Ava.</p><p>Esme called Ryan delusional since Ava despised him, but he felt hate was just the other side of love.</p><p>When Ava appeared on Tuesday’s GH episode, she warned Ryan to get away from Esme or she’d blow his head off.</p><p>Ava quickly realized Esme was in labor and was stunned when Ryan revealed Esme was his daughter.</p><p>Ryan admitted to arranging for Esme to meet Spencer at that snooty school and teaching her how to manipulate him.</p><p>Everything that happened was Ryan’s doing, so he acted like this was his crowning moment – that Esme had brought them all together.</p><p>Ryan moved toward Ava, so she warned that she’d kill him if he took another step.</p><p>Once Ava ranted about Spencer stalking her and Esme being ordered to seduce Nikolas Cassadine (Adam Huss), she seemed like she was coming unhinged.</p><p>Ryan said they were forever, but Ava fired back that he took her daughter and her husband.</p><p>According to Ava, Ryan would keep taking unless somebody stopped him.</p><p>Once Esme snuck away, Ryan was upset over his lost daughter. Ava asked Ryan how it felt to lose the one thing he truly loved and eventually shot him in the shoulder.</p><p>Ryan acknowledged that killing Kiki Jerome (Hayley Erin) might’ve been a mistake, but he insisted he didn’t harm a hair on Nikolas’ head.</p><p>Ava confessed that she did that instead, so Ryan realized she killed Nikolas and thought nothing was standing in their way now.</p><p>Inside Wyndemere, Laura and Kevin came to offer help. Kevin thought Heather would be keen to pitch in as well since her daughter and grandchild were involved.</p><p>Laura sought confirmation that Heather was Esme’s mother, so Heather admitted it by suggesting Esme had her smile.</p><p>Afterward, Esme finally burst through the door again and ran into Laura’s arms.</p><p>Back on the pier, Spencer arrived with Trina since he’d planned to have her crash at Wyndemere with Ava.</p><p>Alexis filled Trina and Spencer in on the hostage chaos, so Spencer was concerned about his little brother or sister.</p><p>When Spencer found out Heather and Ryan were Esme’s biological parents, he looked absolutely floored.</p><p>In the woods, Ryan told Ava that they could vanish once they found Esme and the baby.</p><p>After Ryan talked about holding each other’s lives in their hands, he said “’til death do us part.”</p><p>“’Til death do us part,” Ava echoed as she started to pull the trigger again.</p><p>General Hospital spoilers say Ryan and Ava’s showdown will continue, so don’t miss what’s in store.</p><p>CDL’s the place to be for exciting <a href=# rel=noopener>General Hospital spoilers, updates and news, so make us your favorite GH hotspot.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnl5q7pr7ApWShp6OltrWty2aqqaeZobKzv4ytrJ6rlJbGbrLEm6mumaKuenN9jKucnJmgYr%2B6rc1mo56ZoqPAbq3VmmSkoZyhsqV5zaKiqKSRqHqmv8yeZKudkZi1pr%2BMrJifnaSufA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fgeneral-hospital-spoilers-tuesday-february-21-recap-ryan-learns-ava-killed-nikolas-esme-re.html&text=General%20Hospital%20Spoilers%3a%20Tuesday%2c%20February%2021%20Recap%20%20Ryan%20Learns%20Ava%20Killed%20Nikolas%20%20Esme%20Re&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fgeneral-hospital-spoilers-tuesday-february-21-recap-ryan-learns-ava-killed-nikolas-esme-re.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fgeneral-hospital-spoilers-tuesday-february-21-recap-ryan-learns-ava-killed-nikolas-esme-re.html&title=General%20Hospital%20Spoilers%3a%20Tuesday%2c%20February%2021%20Recap%20%20Ryan%20Learns%20Ava%20Killed%20Nikolas%20%20Esme%20Re" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fgeneral-hospital-spoilers-tuesday-february-21-recap-ryan-learns-ava-killed-nikolas-esme-re.html&title=General%20Hospital%20Spoilers%3a%20Tuesday%2c%20February%2021%20Recap%20%20Ryan%20Learns%20Ava%20Killed%20Nikolas%20%20Esme%20Re" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fgeneral-hospital-spoilers-tuesday-february-21-recap-ryan-learns-ava-killed-nikolas-esme-re.html&title=General%20Hospital%20Spoilers%3a%20Tuesday%2c%20February%2021%20Recap%20%20Ryan%20Learns%20Ava%20Killed%20Nikolas%20%20Esme%20Re" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fgeneral-hospital-spoilers-tuesday-february-21-recap-ryan-learns-ava-killed-nikolas-esme-re.html&description=General%20Hospital%20Spoilers%3a%20Tuesday%2c%20February%2021%20Recap%20%20Ryan%20Learns%20Ava%20Killed%20Nikolas%20%20Esme%20Re" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jamie-dornan-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jamie Dornan Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./bloomberg-s-drexel-milken-oral-history.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bloomberg's Drexel Milken Oral History">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
