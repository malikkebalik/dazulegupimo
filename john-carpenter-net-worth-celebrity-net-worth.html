John Carpenter is best-known for directing cult classics like "Halloween" (1978), "The Thing" (1982), and "Big Trouble in Little China" (1986), and he composed the music for most of his films. John released his first film, "Dark Star," in 1974, and the film's high quality, which was achieved on a shoestring budget, caught Hollywood's attention. His next film, 1976's "Assault on Precinct 13," was a hit in Europe but took longer to catch on in the U.S. Carpenter's third film, "Halloween," would finally establish him as a director/editor/composer of note. The film was made for $320,000 and grossed over $65 million at the box office. Throughout the late 1970s and 1980s, he wrote and directed a string of horror, science-fiction, and thriller hits, including "The Fog" (1980), "Escape from New York" (1981), "Christine" (1983), and "Starman" (1984). John has directed 18 feature films, and in 2019, the French Directors' Guild honored him with a Golden Coach Award (Carrosse d'Or) at the Cannes Film Festival.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>John Carpenter was born John Howard Carpenter on January 16, 1948, in Carthage, New York. He grew up in Bowling Green, Kentucky, with mother Milton Jean and father Howard (a music professor), and he became interested in movies at a young age, especially Westerns, horror films, and science-fiction. In 1962, John began making short horror movies with 8 mm film, and after graduating from high school, he enrolled at Western Kentucky University, where his father was head of the music department. Carpenter transferred to the University of Southern California in 1968 and studied at the School of Cinematic Arts. During his second year of film school, John co-wrote, edited, and composed the score for the short film "The Resurrection of Broncho Billy." The film went on to win the Oscar for Best Live-Action Short Subject in 1970, and it won a CINE Golden Eagle for Student Film at the 1971 CINE Competition.

"Halloween" was released on October 25, 1978, and it remains one of the most popular slasher films in movie history. The film, which John co-wrote, directed, and scored, has led to 10 more "Halloween" films, with two more, "Halloween Kills" and "Halloween Ends," in the works. In 2006, "Halloween" was preserved in the Library of Congress's United States National Film Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant."</p><p>In 1979, Carpenter directed the TV movie "<a href=# title="Elvis Net Worth">Elvis</a>," which starred <a href=# title="Kurt Russell Net Worth">Kurt Russell</a>, who would become a frequent collaborator of John's.
