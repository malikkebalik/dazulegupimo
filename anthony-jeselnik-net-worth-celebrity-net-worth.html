In 2011, Anthony earned a Primetime Emmy nomination for Outstanding Writing for a Variety, Music or Comedy Special for "Night of Too Many Stars: An Overbooked Concert for Autism Education."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Anthony Jeselnik was born on December 22, 1978, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He grew up in Upper St. Clair with mother Stephanie, father Anthony (an attorney), three sisters, and a brother. Anthony became interested in making people laugh at a young age and would often crack jokes in class. After a teacher laughed at one of his jokes, Jeselnik realized, "If you're smart enough that adults gets it, you can get away with anything."</p><p>Anthony attended Upper St. Clair High School, and after graduating in 1997, he enrolled at Tulane University. While attending Tulane, he joined the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity, and in 2001, he earned an English literature degree with a minor in business. Jeselnik moved to Los Angeles in his early twenties, and while working at Borders, he came across a book by comedian Greg Dean and found out about Dean's comedy workshops in Santa Monica.</p><p>Anthony's first joke involved an impression of his dad being stung by wasps, and when no one laughed, he decided that physical comedy wasn't for him. After losing his job at Borders, Jeselnik found work as an accounting clerk at Deadwood and performed at open mic nights. Two years after he began performing stand-up comedy, he had a "lightbulb moment" when audiences responded positively to a dark joke. He later included the joke, "My girlfriend loves to eat chocolate," on his first album, "Shakespeare."</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-67471 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/anthony-jeselnik-ftr.jpg alt="Anthony Jeselnik" width=900 height=563 sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-67471 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Jeselnik made his television debut on Comedy Central's "Premium Blend" in 2006, and he appeared on "Late Night with Conan O'Brien" and "Down and Dirty with <a href=# title="Jim Norton Net Worth">Jim Norton</a>" in 2008. In 2009, he got his own "Comedy Central Presents" special and was featured on "Comedy Central's Hot List." From 2009 to 2010, Anthony wrote for the first season of "Late Night with Jimmy Fallon" and occasionally appeared on the show. Around this time, he also regularly performed at the Comedy Cellar in New York City. In 2010, he released his debut comedy album, "Shakespeare," and began writing for Comedy Central's roasts, beginning with the "Comedy Central Roast of David Hasselhoff." He later performed on the "Comedy Central Roast of <a href=# title="Donald Trump Net Worth">Donald Trump</a>" (2011), "Comedy Central Roast of <a href=# title="Charlie Sheen Net Worth">Charlie Sheen</a>" (2011), and "Comedy Central Roast of <a href=# title="Roseanne Barr Net Worth">Roseanne Barr</a>" (2012). Jeselnik said of his first roast performance, "One of my favorite moments of my life was doing that Trump roast, because no one knew who I was and it just really caught everybody by surprise. And the next day, my life was completely different." After the Trump roast, Comedy Central offered Anthony a deal that included an hour-long special, three roasts, and a development deal.</p><p>In 2013, Jeselnik released the comedy album "Caligula," which reached #1 on the "Billboard" Top Comedy Albums chart and also aired as a Comedy Central special. That year he began hosting "The Jeselnik Offensive" on Comedy Central, and it aired 18 episodes over two seasons. On one episode, Anthony had a "shark party" after a New Zealander was killed in a shark attack, and he received online death threats from people in New Zealand. Someone also posted his parents' address and phone number online, and they began receiving death threats as well. In 2015, Netflix released the comedy special "Thoughts and Prayers," and Jeselnik hosted season nine of "Last Comic Standing" alongside judges Norm Macdonald, <a href=# title="Keenen Ivory Wayans Net Worth">Keenen Ivory Wayans</a>, and Roseanne Barr.

I rejected it later on. I'm an outspoken atheist now. People say, 'Oh, it's a negative thing to be an atheist.' I don't agree. I think it's more optimistic to think that there is no God, no afterlife. I'm the only one in my family who feels this way." Anthony has been a fan of the Pittsburgh Steelers since his youth, and in 2016, he told "Steeler Nation" that his favorite players, past and present, are <a href=# title="Jerome Bettis Net Worth">Jerome Bettis</a>, <a href=# title="Hines Ward Net Worth">Hines Ward</a>, and <a href=# title="Antonio Brown Net Worth">Antonio Brown</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR70aKaoZ2jqXqku8yem6KZnqh8orrToaansV2fsrSxy6egpGWemsFuw86rq6Fn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fanthony-jeselnik-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Anthony%20Jeselnik%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fanthony-jeselnik-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fanthony-jeselnik-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Anthony%20Jeselnik%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fanthony-jeselnik-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Anthony%20Jeselnik%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fanthony-jeselnik-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Anthony%20Jeselnik%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fanthony-jeselnik-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Anthony%20Jeselnik%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./do-on-camera-clients-get-their-pets-treatments-for-free.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Do On-Camera Clients Get Their Pets' Treatments for Free?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-juvenile-dating-juvenile-s-wife-exes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Juvenile Dating  Juvenile's Wife &amp;amp; Exes">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
