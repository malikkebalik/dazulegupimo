Starring Colin Farrell, the film boasted an ensemble cast that included <a href=#>actors</a> Angelina Jolie, Val Kilmer, and Rosario Dawson. Dawson, whose career was gaining momentum, grabbed Stone’s attention in many ways. And one of those ways was because the actor looked strikingly similar to Angelina Jolie.</p><h2 id=h-how-rosario-dawson-got-the-role-in-alexander><strong>How Rosario Dawson got the role in ‘Alexander’</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Rosario-Dawson.jpg><p id=par-2_41>Rosario Dawson was determined to feature in an Oliver Stone project. However, there was a point where Dawson’s scheduling would’ve prevented her from being a part of Alexander. Initially, <a href=#>the Rent star</a> thought her chances of getting the role were slim.</p><p id=par-3_43>“I had auditioned for it and there was this whole thing about, they probably still won’t be able to hire you,” Dawson told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tribute</a>. “There’s a certain quota of European actors he has to hire because he had a lot of European financing.”</p><p id=par-4_35>Dawson started exploring roles in other films as Stone hadn’t made up his mind on casting her. She nearly signed onto a contract that would’ve made her unavailable. Fortunately for Dawson, however, her agent interfered.</p><p id=par-5_79>“So my agent called him up and gave him the ultimatum. Like, ‘Listen, she doesn’t have time for you to go to France and figure out what you want to do. You make her an offer now or you don’t at all,’” Dawson recalled. “And I’m like going, ‘What are you doing, you don’t give Oliver Stone an ultimatum. I really, really want this part. You know, kiss his butt. That’s what I want you to do for me.’”</p><p id=par-6_21>Much to Dawson’s relief, Stone called her a couple of days later to let her know that she secured the role.</p><h2 id=h-oliver-stone-cast-rosario-dawson-in-alexander-because-she-looked-a-lot-like-angelina-jolie><strong>Oliver Stone cast Rosario Dawson in ‘Alexander’ because she looked a lot like Angelina Jolie</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_43>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Contact Music</a>, part of the reason Rosario Dawson managed to nab the role in Alexander was because of <a href=#>The Mandalorian actor’s</a> resemblance to Jolie. Director Oliver Stone felt that the similarities between Dawson and Jolie would play upon Alexander’s Oedipus complex.</p><p id=par-8_26>“He was looking and looking at me and he said, ‘On-camera you look a lot like Angelina Jolie – the strong jaw, the lips,” Dawson shared.</p><p id=par-9_32>Director Oliver Stone felt that the similarities between Dawson and Jolie would play upon an Oedipus complex Stone commented believed Alexander experienced. Dawson also agreed with Stone’s sentiments about Alexander’s Oedipus complex.</p><p id=par-10_31>“(He said) He (Alexander) was notoriously gay…and I like to think that something about Roxane reminds him of his mother. An Oedipal thing. I want to play off that,” Dawson added.</p><h2 id=h-how-rosario-dawson-being-naked-in-alexander-impacted-her-future-film-roles>How Rosario Dawson being naked in ‘Alexander’ impacted her future film roles</h2><p id=par-11_40>Rosario Dawson had a bit of a difficult time after shooting a nude scene in Alexander. The <a href=#>Sin City alum</a> revealed that, because of Stone’s film, many casting directors wanted her in more revealing clothes. A preference that annoyed Dawson.</p><p id=par-12_58>“I’d perform my ass off, and the casting directors would be like, ‘You are perfect for this role, but can you wear something a little less shapeless?’” Dawson confided to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a>. “I’m like, ‘Ugh, fine’, but these stupid conversations needed to be had, because unfortunately, don’t believe what they tell you, there’s very little imagination in Hollywood.”</p><p id=par-13_14>Dawson noted that her nude scene in Alexander is available all over the internet.</p><p id=par-14_33>“No, not at all,” Dawson answered when asked if that fact bothered her. “My point being: then don’t complain, ‘We don’t know what she really looks like.’ Are you kidding?! Do your research.”</p><p id=par-15_16>Dawson further illustrated her point by recalling what she heard an executive once say about her.</p><p id=par-16_45>“’She looks a little fat right now,’” she remembered. “Really? They’re called breasts … There was definitely a period for a couple of years where I rebelled against it. It probably cost me a lot of really big jobs, but I was just so angry.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FsL%2FAq6CoZZSWxLS7zWaamqukYq6tsdeapZ2domKxqr7EnKuoql2ptbDBxqGrZqSfpLimsIyapaCdnJ67onnJqKOinV6dwa64jg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frosario-dawson-was-cast-in-alexander-because-the-director-thought-she-looked-like-angelina-jolie.html&text=Rosario%20Dawson%20Was%20Cast%20in%20%27Alexander%27%20Because%20the%20Director%20Thought%20She%20Looked%20Like%20Angelina%20Jolie&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frosario-dawson-was-cast-in-alexander-because-the-director-thought-she-looked-like-angelina-jolie.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frosario-dawson-was-cast-in-alexander-because-the-director-thought-she-looked-like-angelina-jolie.html&title=Rosario%20Dawson%20Was%20Cast%20in%20%27Alexander%27%20Because%20the%20Director%20Thought%20She%20Looked%20Like%20Angelina%20Jolie" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frosario-dawson-was-cast-in-alexander-because-the-director-thought-she-looked-like-angelina-jolie.html&title=Rosario%20Dawson%20Was%20Cast%20in%20%27Alexander%27%20Because%20the%20Director%20Thought%20She%20Looked%20Like%20Angelina%20Jolie" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frosario-dawson-was-cast-in-alexander-because-the-director-thought-she-looked-like-angelina-jolie.html&title=Rosario%20Dawson%20Was%20Cast%20in%20%27Alexander%27%20Because%20the%20Director%20Thought%20She%20Looked%20Like%20Angelina%20Jolie" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frosario-dawson-was-cast-in-alexander-because-the-director-thought-she-looked-like-angelina-jolie.html&description=Rosario%20Dawson%20Was%20Cast%20in%20%27Alexander%27%20Because%20the%20Director%20Thought%20She%20Looked%20Like%20Angelina%20Jolie" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sister-wives-meri-brown-net-worth-and-clothing-line-explained.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sister Wives Meri Brown net worth and clothing line explained">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mattress-mack-is-one-astros-win-away-from-75-million.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mattress Mack Is One Astros Win Away From $75 Million">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
