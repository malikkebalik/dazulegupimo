The music biopic, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Dirt</a>, was released earlier this year. It has both fans, and those new to the band, entranced with the wild drama that is Motley Crue. In this article, we’re going to discuss each member and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>what they’re worth</a>. Who’s the richest member of Motley Crue? Let’s find out.</p><h2>Who is Motley Crue?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/motley-crue-richest-member.jpg><p id=par-2_58>The heavy metal rock band Motley Crue was formed in 1981 and has sold over 100 million albums. It’s comprised of four members: Nikki Sixx, Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, and Mick Mars. The band took the saying, “sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll” to the extreme, with wild parties, drug overdoses, and on-stage explosions being a regular occurrence.</p><p id=par-3_55>“I wanted a band that would be like David Bowie and the Sex Pistols thrown in a blender with Black Sabbath,” Sixx said, while reflecting on the band’s creation with the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> LA Times</a>. Motley Crue is responsible for hits like, Girls, Girls, Girls, Home Sweet Home, Kickstart My Heart, and Looks That Kill, among others.</p><h2>Nikki Sixx</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_71>The bassist of Motley Crue, Sixx, has been a member of several other bands both before and after his Motley Crue fame. During his <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>time with Motley Crue</a>, Sixx became addicted to heroin. A disease he chronicled in his book, The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star, which he released in 2007. The book debuted at number seven on The New York Times Bestsellers list.</p><p id=par-5_41>Sixx dated tattoo artist Kat Von D from 2008 to 2010, even appearing on her reality show, LA Ink. He is now married to model Courtney Bingham, his third wife. He is still making music, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">currently</a> worth <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$45 million.</a></p><h2>Tommy Lee</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-6_48>The band’s drummer, Lee is well known in pop culture. He’s performed with several successful musical artists, including The Deftones, The Smashing Pumpkins, and Ludacris. Lee created a rap metal band in 1999, called Methods of Mayhem, and continues to be an influential figure in the music industry.</p><p id=par-7_51>Lee made headlines with his third wife, actress Pamela Anderson, when their sex tape was released to the public. However, he is currently married to social media celebrity, Brittany Furlan, since February 2019. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lee is probably the most well known</a> member of Motley Crue, and worth an estimated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">$70 million</a> dollars.</p><h2>Vince Neil</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-8_49>Neil is the lead vocalist for Motley Crue. His long blond hair and screeching vocal style was a focal point for the band. Before Neil joined Motley Crue, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>he was told</a> by his high school friend, Lee: “I told them about you bro. They saw you and they’re stoked.”</p><p id=par-9_47>In 1995, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>tragedy struck</a>, when Neil’s four-year-old daughter died of cancer. The event issued in a self-destructive phase of his life, where he was very angry, suicidal, and using a lot of alcohol and drugs. The story is chronicled in both the book and movie, The Dirt.</p><p id=par-10_56>Neil is also known for his solo work, and a long history of arrests, including several instances of drunk driving, and assault. Neil is currently not married. He separated from his fourth wife, Lia Gerardini in 2010. Their wedding was officiated by MC Hammer and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">described</a> as “very romantic with a touch of rock and roll.”</p><p id=par-11_9>Neil has a current <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">net worth</a> of $50 million.</p><h2>Mick Mars</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-5></figure><p id=par-12_73>Known for his aggressive, melodic solos, and bluesy riffs, Mars is the lead guitarist for the band. He dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music and found success when he joined Motley Crue. Throughout his career, Mars has openly struggled with a chronic inflammatory form of arthritis, called ankylosing spondylitis. He had <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>hip replacement surgery</a> in 2004, because of the condition. Mars has a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>net worth</a> of $40 million.</p><h2>Who is the richest member of Motley Crue?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-6></figure><p id=par-13_59>Lee is the richest member of Motley Crue, with a net worth of $70 million. His continued wealth is due to the fact that Lee remains a popular figure in pop culture. Unlike some of the other members of the bands, Lee has managed to be a household name, by staying relevant and by playing with current music artists.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTEqbuMoqpmrJiaerO1wqGcrKxdorKursSrZKieXaK8tbjEsmScqqWae6nAzKVm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-the-richest-member-of-motley-crue.html&text=Who%20Is%20the%20Richest%20Member%20of%20Motley%20Crue%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-the-richest-member-of-motley-crue.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-richest-member-of-motley-crue.html&title=Who%20Is%20the%20Richest%20Member%20of%20Motley%20Crue%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-the-richest-member-of-motley-crue.html&title=Who%20Is%20the%20Richest%20Member%20of%20Motley%20Crue%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-the-richest-member-of-motley-crue.html&title=Who%20Is%20the%20Richest%20Member%20of%20Motley%20Crue%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-the-richest-member-of-motley-crue.html&description=Who%20Is%20the%20Richest%20Member%20of%20Motley%20Crue%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mattress-mack-is-one-astros-win-away-from-75-million.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mattress Mack Is One Astros Win Away From $75 Million">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vivienne-westwood-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vivienne Westwood Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
